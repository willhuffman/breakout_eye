Simple Breakout 0.4!

A basic breakout game, since I felt like making one.

To navigate menu:

up and down arrows
return to select

To play game:

paddle is controlled with mouse.
return to pause during gameplay.

to use the level editor:

left click for options at the top of the window. left
click to add block, right click to remove it.

Known glitches:

Collision *sometimes* does quirky things (but mostly not). And the game doesn't
pause if focus leaves it.
